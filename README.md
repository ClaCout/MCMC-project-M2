# MCMC-project-M2
My first Github repository will store the notebook and libraries related to my master 2 machine learning project
on Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm applied to icequakes.

We want to know the ice thickness, longitude, latitude and time offset of an icequake. 
We only have the sismographs and scalograms of the icequake, surveyed by stations. The MCMC algorithm with Simulated Annealing is a way to 
find values for the parameters that best fit the observations.
